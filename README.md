2. **Divisive Methods**:  
   - Start with the entire graph as one community.  
   - Remove critical edges (like the edge with the highest betweenness) to split the graph into subgroups.  
3. **Label Propagation**:  
   - Each node is initially assigned a unique label.  
   - Labels propagate through the network, with nodes adopting the most frequent label among their neighbors.  
   - Nodes with the same label form communities.  
4. **Louvain Method**:  
   - Divides the graph by optimizing modularity in multiple phases.  
   - After initial clustering, nodes are regrouped into "supernodes," and the process is repeated for further refinement.

#### **Applications**  
1. **Marketing Campaigns**: Target specific communities for product promotions.  
2. **Public Health**: Identify at-risk groups for targeted interventions.  
3. **Information Spread**: Study how information flows within communities.

### **Introduction to Recommender Systems**  
Recommender systems are algorithms designed to suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences, behavior, and network interactions. They are widely used in e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social networks.

#### **Types of Recommender Systems**  
1. **Content-Based Filtering**:  
   - Recommends items similar to those the user has previously interacted with.  
   - Relies on item features (e.g., genre, tags) and user preferences.  
   - Example: A user who likes action movies is recommended other action movies.  
2. **Collaborative Filtering**:  
   - Identifies similar users based on shared behavior or preferences.  
   - Two types:  
     - **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items liked by users with similar tastes.  
     - **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items that are often co-preferred by users.  
   - Example: A user who buys a phone is recommended accessories based on other users’ buying patterns.  
3. **Hybrid Systems**:  
   - Combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques for better accuracy.  
   - Example: Netflix recommends movies based on both user preferences and similar user behavior.  

#### **Key Applications**  
1. **E-Commerce**: Suggest products based on purchase history.  
2. **Streaming Platforms**: Recommend movies, shows, or songs.  
3. **Social Networks**: Suggest friends, groups, or pages.

#### **Benefits of Recommender Systems**  
1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Personalized recommendations increase engagement.  
2. **Improved Revenue**: Encourages repeat purchases or subscriptions.  
3. **Data Utilization**: Leverages user behavior to drive business insights.
